# FlutterCalendarApp

Welcome to our Flutter-based mobile application, developed as a final semester project for our mobile development course. Our team is proud to introduce this innovative tool designed to assist students in managing their schedules by directly retrieving their timetables through the CAUportal API.

## **Main Features:**

### **1. Personalizable Interactive Calendar**
- **Multiple Viewing Options**: Experience various views like day, week, and month planning to suit your preference.
- **Dual Calendar Display**: Choose between both of your calendars to display your events, you can select both at the same time

### **2. Integration with Chung Ang University API**
- **Automatic Course Calendar**: If access is granted, our app will fetch your assigned courses from the Chung Ang University API and create a dedicated calendar for your classes.
